/**
 * Special type of tree which knows his {@link PreNode} owner. The <code>AVLItemAccessor</code> always
 * return the number of the <code>PreNode</code> linked to the owner.
 * <p>
 * This type of tree stores {@link AbstractEdge}. These edges can be <b>IN</b> or <b>OUT</b>. The instance
 * of the edge is duplicated in each node, once as <b>IN</b> and once as <b>OUT</b>. In each node, the
 * tree key must be the neigbour's number. So the <code>getNumber()</code> method compare the given
 * item with the owner and returns the neighbour's number.
