/**
 * Type of AVL tree with a special {@link AVLItemAccessor} which always return the <b><code>maxNode</code></b>
 * number of the {@link PreEdge} item.
 * <p>
 * This type of tree is used by the {@link PreNode} to store <b>forward edges</b>. These edges can use
 * <code>minNode</code> or <code>maxNode</code> as a key for this AVL tree. When forward edges are stored
 * in a <code>PreNode</code>, the <code>minNode</code> is actually the <code>PreNode</code> number and the
 * <code>maxNode</code> the neigbours' number. That's why the <code>getNumber()</code> of the tree returns
 * the <code>maxNode</code>.
